val pp_systemd_header : (Logs.level * string option) Fmt.t
(** A header which displays only log level, suited for systemd's
    journalctl. *)

val reporter :
  ?pp_header:(Logs.level * string option) Fmt.t -> unit -> Logs.reporter
(** The following reporter will play nice with [Async]'s runtime, it
    will behave synchronously for the log functions of this module and
    asynchronously for those of the {!Logs} module (see {!Logs.sync}).

    It reuses {!Logs_fmt.reporter} and will produce colorful output if
    the standard formatters are setup to do so. For example it can be
    used instead of {!Logs_fmt.reporter} in the {{!Logs_cli.ex}full
    setup example}. *)

val level_arg : Logs.level option Async.Command.Arg_type.t
(** Argument type to be used for use in [Command] params. *)

val set_level_via_param :
  ?arg_name:string -> ?doc:string ->  Logs.src list -> unit Async.Command.Param.t
(** [set_level_via_param src] is a param that sets the level of [srcs]
    (or all srcs if [src] is [None]). *)
